# Project Overview

#The goal of this analysis is to predict people's body condition - ‘extremely overweight’, ‘fit’, ‘malnourished’, 
‘overweight’, ‘slightly overweight’, or ‘underweight’ - based on their gender, height, and weight. To achieve this,
I utilized a machine learning model, specifically a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), which was trained on a dataset 
containing the features ‘Gender’, ‘Height’, and ‘Weight’.”
